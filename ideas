Get a lot of sentences
Tokenize them
Build a word frequency list
For each word find a sentence which suits the best
It shouldn't contain any unknown words, but there should be some maximum allowed "lookahead"
For the first N words, the lookahead should be higher (a pool of starting vocabulary)

Maybe some reordering/skipping should be allowed when it produces a higher-quality result
- Keep a list of words needed to make a word ready to add (unknown words which are in the wanted example sentence)
- Do it with something akin to reference counting, to make it performant
